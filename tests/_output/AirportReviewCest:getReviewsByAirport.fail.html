{"reviews":[{"date":"2015-08-01","overall_rating":"7.00","author_country":"United Arab Emirates","content":"Arrived on BA from Dubai at Terminal 5 at around 6 am, along with a bunch of long-haul 747\/777\/A380 arrivals from all over the world. There were bottlenecks on the walk from the gate down to the shuttle trains which take people from the remote satellite terminals to the 'main' part of T5 which houses passport control\/baggage reclaim as well as check-in\/security on departure. Had to wait around 20 minutes to get on a train, because in many cases the shuttles would arrive from the previous stop (the C gates) already full. Was a bit stressful. At passport control, it was a 30-minute wait for non-EU nationals, expected as this was the morning rush. Immigration officer was courteous and polite (am a frequent visitor to the UK, so minimal questions asked). She endorsed (i.e. stamped) the wrong visa, and when I pointed out her error, she rectified her mistake with minimal fuss. Bags didn't take much time. Very convenient vending machines if you need to pick up a SIM card in the baggage claim hall-if not, there are several shops in the arrivals area selling UK SIM cards, plus WHSmith and a few other outlets. Signage to Heathrow Express clear, and in 20 minutes was in central London. Departure: Arrived on the HEX, and wanted to do VAT refund, but the office was on the other side of the terminal, and quite busy at that, so I ended up ditching-they should have a VAT refund office on either end of the large T5 check-in area. My flight left at 1pm, and there were quite a number of flights leaving, a mixture of European and intercontinental flights. Used self-service kiosks to print BPs, then waited for a good 30 minutes in the bag drop queue. Would be much more efficient to have a proper self check-in service, where passengers can print and stick their bag tags themselves. Although the queue to get into security was short, getting in line to go through the scanner, then waiting again for the bags to come out through the machine all ended up taking a good 15 minutes. By then, only had 70 minutes or so until departure. Bearing in mind that my flight left from Gate B35, which required another ride on the shuttle, only had 20-25 minutes to grab a bit and run. Despite arriving 3 hours in advance, with the all the walking and waiting, felt like I was cutting it close. Overall a mixed bag. I highly recommend anyone planning on doing a VAT refund to get there a good 4 hours before their flight (and of course, you need to be prepared to show them your purchases, so unless it's in your carry-on, you need to do this before checking in your bags)."},{"date":"2015-07-28","overall_rating":"1.00","author_country":"United States","content":"In all my traveling years, never such rudeness and unprofessional treatment than by a staff at Heathrow Airport. Request for assistance was turned down in my attempt to ask for the need for landing card as my next flight was leaving in the next three hours and another staff member sitting at a chair next to immigration line as I was waiting to have my passport stamped, harassed me about stepping out of the line to talk with her about how I was talking to the other staff in my inquiry about the landing card. She continued to lecture me  how I should correctly\"talk to the staff.  I suggest the staff be retrained on their customer service skills.

My partner and I used the self service boarding pass scanners just before security, only to find before we boarded that they hadn't worked properly. Although the gates had opened and let us and several other travellers through they had not taken the picture. After this came security, which was fine. However, after this there appeared to be no signs pointing you to border control, and in fact it was tucked away in a corner on a lower level. we walked around in a confused state with no staff actively trying to mange this. The building is designed horribly so that you have no real confidence about where you are going. A rude immigration officer completed the experience for us. Absolutely terrible."},{"date":"2015-07-24","overall_rating":"1.00","author_country":"United States","content":"So, arrive at Edinburgh Intl Airport on time and go through the usually inefficient but very thorough UK security screening and passport control. This works relatively 'well'. Our flight arrives late to Heathrow though, and then the real fun begins. After a thorough security check by British officials in Edinburgh, we are subject to that all over again after an excruciatingly long bus ride between idiotically poorly connected terminals (arrival at T5 and departure for LAX at T3). Both times we're \"randomly picked\" for a 2nd level security check. So OK, through all that and then we need to re-check in again for the AA flight to LAX (after printing boarding passes online with all docs verified). Why? Then we are so lucky to actually learn of the departure gate a full 5 minutes before all the other clueless passengers who are anxiously watching the monitors. This is one of the silliest parts of the operation: holding the gate secret until 20 minutes before boarding. Anyway, rush to the very far away gate, and then into a new secure area- yes another check of passport and boarding pass that gains us access to the usual ugly 'stall' with no services and no bathrooms. There more poor people (thankfully not us) being checked by yet more random searching. Heathrow, the world's worst large-sized airport in my opinion, needs to have its security and other logistical systems completely overhauled by efficiency experts. It's an embarrassment to the UK."},{"date":"2015-07-21","overall_rating":"8.00","author_country":"United States","content":"Terminal 5. Architecturally impressive, with great views and lots of natural light. Plenty of stores to keep avid shoppers occupied. The four hours of free Wi-Fi offered is a nice touch. Distances are long however, and both my recent flights arrived at either a remote stand or the satellite terminal. The policy of announcing the departure gate only an hour beforehand is annoying, especially if the departure is from the B or C gates, which take a while to get to."},{"date":"2015-07-21","overall_rating":"1.00","author_country":"United Kingdom","content":"I completely agree with reviews submitted by Alan Gerbhart and Michelle Strauss. It took me 70 minutes from arrival to clearing security into Terminal 5A on 21st July despite having \"fast-track\". At immigration there was a problem scanning a baby's eyes but instead of taking the issue aside the immigration people (5) dealt with the issue at the desk holding every other customer back - there was no other desk in use at this point as every immigration officer decided they would also assist with the baby - ridiculous, and no apology obviously. At security the queues were surprisingly short (see immigration issue) but they still insisted on swabbing bags and items unnecessarily, even lifting chocolates out of my daughters bag and re-scanning them - why? We also had a duty free bottle of perfume, sealed in the bag with the receipt but again they insisted on opening it and testing it - is there no-one with any common sense employed? And of course no sign of supervision or management anywhere. I compare you to many other international hubs I travel through and without doubt immigration and security here are the worst for organisation, worst for customer service and worst for passenger management I have ever had the displeasure to come across. "},{"date":"2015-07-20","overall_rating":"3.00","author_country":"United Kingdom","content":"Terminal 2 - This Terminal appears to have been deliberately designed to make things as difficult as possible for passengers to negotiate. If you are not young and fit I would suggest you avoid it. I have some mobility issues and I found this Terminal difficult in the extreme. Plenty of room in Car Park then lifts take you to area out in front of Terminal Building. When you enter you are met by automatic check-in machines with desks behind but no staff to help you find out what you need to do. I decided to avoid the machines and eventually find the EVA Air Business Class check-in desk. Staff here were excellent. I make my way to Security. Despite being very quiet, passengers are still made to snake through the movable barriers forcing them to walk about 20 times further than necessary. Fairly quick getting through the checks and then passports. Now the problems really begin. The signs inside the Terminal building are unclear and totally inadequate. I eventually work out I now need to go down a level. The lifts throughout the terminal are generally tucked away, difficult to find, and at least half appear to be marked 'Staff Only'. At the next level I again can't find any clear signs to show how to get to the Business Lounge, which I was told was near the gate. The design of this level is awful. There are no clear, easy routes to get across. Passengers are forced to walk much further than necessary. It appears to be in order to make them go as close to as many shops as possible. I eventually find the exit I need in the far corner. I now have to go down yet another level. I am now faced with a lifeless corridor. It is a very, very long walk from here to the gates and the Lounge. There are some moving walkways. By the time I get close to the gates I am in pain. I now discover I have to go back up a level to get to the Lounge. Unbelievable! I then have to go back down and walk a little further to get to the gate when it's time to board. Boarding was shambolic. No information given. One mad scrum and slow moving queues. Arriving back in the Terminal was no better. On leaving the plane I have to immediately use a small, slow lift to go up a level. There is then quite a walk. I then have to find a lift to go up another level. The lifts are an even further walk, with confusing signs and most of the lifts marked 'Staff Only' or 'Buggies Only'. The sign in the lift says I need Level 3 for Arrivals but there are only buttons for 0 and 2! There is then a very, very, very long walk and the need to use yet another lift. I eventually get to Passport Control. I have a Priority Lane pass but there are very few staff in it so there is quite a wait. Through Customs then outside to find the way to taxis. I find I have to walk to the other end of the concourse and go down a level in the lift. I then have another quite long walk to the taxi queue. There are plenty of taxis for the number of people waiting but only one member of Airport staff doing the taxi bookings. A long wait. I have travelled a great deal over many years and Heathrow T2 is, without doubt, the worst one I have gone through in terms of access, passenger convenience and ease of use. I find it staggering that it has been expensively re-designed very recently and this us the result. I shall be doing all I can to avoid using it"},{"date":"2015-07-20","overall_rating":"1.00","author_country":"United Kingdom","content":"Travelling with a disabled person. Regret to report that compared to all other airports we used Heathrow came a long way last. Wheelchair users - don't let them take your wheelchair away until you get to the plane. We did and my wife was taken by LHR wheelchair to a holding area where she was put on a seat and the wheelchair taken away - and left there for over an hour. She was then taken by buggy to a lift and had to \"walk\" to the departure gate where she was transferred to transport to the plane. On our return to LHR we held onto the wheelchair which was brought to the plane but it took over 45 minutes to arrange transport to the baggage reclaim."},{"date":"2015-07-10","overall_rating":"1.00","author_country":"Germany","content":"Terminal 5 : I cannot echo enough the review of Michelle Straus. From the time I put my first bag on the belt to the time I got my bags back after a pointless swabbing exercise was 35 mins. Queuing time to get to the belt was only 7 mins. The whole process needs review - rejecting bags randomly and then swabbing them 20 times while mountains of luggage build up on the belts and people are in a frenzy to catch their flights.  Don't use the excuse \"but we are just keeping you safe Sir\" - other airports keep us equally safe in a much more pleasant and stress free fashion. I don't think its a staff issue, and maybe their sullenness is simply a defence against the barrage of abuse they suffer for being at the front end of stupid processes."},{"date":"2015-07-08","overall_rating":"1.00","author_country":"Ireland","content":"I echo everything that Alan Gebhart put in his review - the insistence on swabbing each offending item unnecessarily, whilst massive queues build up.

It's a most unpleasant experience using this airport."},{"date":"2015-07-08","overall_rating":"7.00","author_country":"United States","content":"Our first time through Heathrow, there was a guide to tell people which way to go when they disembarked from their connecting flight. On the way back, we had to find someone to help us. We only had an hour layover coming back to the USA. Security is very slow at this airport. We would not have made our connecting flight if I had not asked one of the security personnel to help us get through so as not to miss the flight. He was nice and helped us get through the line. It is better to have about a two hour layover to make a connecting flight here."},{"date":"2015-07-03","overall_rating":"3.00","author_country":"United Kingdom","content":"Having limited mobility, and only able to walk very slowly, and painfully, with the aid of two crutches, we arrived at Terminal 5, (Mid morning - Thursday 18th June) and pressed the outside button for those who require assistance. We were told that somebody would be with us in 5 minutes. Half an hour later, and despite a further 3\/4 presses on the bell, still nothing. Eventually, as time was passing by quickly, and we needed to catch the flight, I slowly hobbled to the desk where this lack of service was 'co-ordinated'. The only explanation given by the sole person at the desk for this lack of service was that neither he, nor the woman pushing the wheelchair, knew where the various numbered locations were around the airport! Eventually I was taken in a chair, to the relevant Gate for the flight, but had to painfully and slowly walk the remaining distance to board the aircraft. Although allowed to set off before other passengers, in order that I could get to the seat before fellow passengers, this wasn\u2019t possible, as I was soon overtaken by others on the way. Arrival back at Terminal 5 wasn't much better, again with some delay, finally being 'dumped' at baggage reclaim, although we had none to collect, and that was it! From there to the area where the taxi could pick us up, was a further long walk.

The walk from the Heathrow express station seemed never ending then after check-in it was time to face the security check, why do they always treat people as though you've never flown before, my iPad was in my hand and my liquids in a bag, this being my 11th trip of the year, they seem to forget I am an airport customer not just a flight ticket. If they were ever polite I would think there was something wrong. I found the process of going through check in and security very faceless and impersonal, then when I got through the to the airside part of the terminal I found terminal two very cramped, the food available very lacking and overpriced, in fact the meal deal in WH Smiths was the best choice. Overall my thoughts of Heathrow is that they want my money but forget what the passenger actually wants or how we wish to be treated."},{"date":"2015-06-27","overall_rating":"8.00","author_country":"Philippines","content":"Terminal 3. No major problems with arrival (6.30am) though lots of walking. The automated passport machines seem pointless as they aren't much faster than human beings. Getting to the underground is easy enough.

I have transited or arrived in LHR more times than I can count, always on British Airways. This was the worst experience ever. My traveling companion had forgotten to remove two small liquid containers from his luggage to be scanned separately in a plastic bag. Although we were in the FastTrack line, we were shunted off to a secondary screening line where the hand baggage of individual passengers who did not somehow pass the screening were sent. The gentleman at the head of the line said he had been there for over an hour and had already missed his flight. There were a number of other people in line. The secondary screeners were rude and unprofessional, and the process was vastly over-complicated. Security is a necessity, but efficiency is also important. It appeared that each individual compartment in any hand luggage that had some sort of violation had to be swabbed, and the swabs read. There was a single person doing this, and the line kept getting longer and longer. A supervisor came over several times but left after a few minutes, doing nothing to remedy the hold-ups. We finally were cleared after almost 90 minutes in this line. The offending liquids could have been removed, put into a separate tray, and the offending liquids and bags could have been resent through the screening machines. This process is often used in other airports when there is a problem with hand baggage. This was the worst and most unprofessional screening I have ever seen.

(2) Security can be very time-consuming, especially and oddly on weekend mornings. Allow plenty of time. (3) While the UK is (still) in the EU, it is not a Schengen country.

Finally got through. Found a lot of the terminal was under renovation. All the shops were luxury shops too expensive for most people and the restaurants were the same. And the terminal was very overcrowded. Then when I went to get my flight directions were poor realised very late that my gate was on lower level. Other passengers were also late finding the gate. Then had to take bus a ridiculously long way to the plane. It took forever. So flight was late departing which meant being stuck in a long queue to take off.

On departure the check-in area is large and spacious like the old T1 its on a level up from roadside so you approach via an elevated road. Once through security (no problems there with the staff) there are enough seats for everyone. My main gripe is the place lacks that certain atmosphere the old T2 had. It all seemed a bit too new and sterile. Walking under the aircraft parking area to get to the departure gate was a little annoying but moving walkways help. On return the corridor from the gate to the security\/passport area is so narrow its a joke. That said everything is on one level and walking distances are short. Spoilt by the queue at the e-passport booths but made up somewhat by fast baggage delivery and a short walk to get outside for the buses to the car parks.

Whilst the new terminal is obviously a generational step forward on the old many of the practical aspects of the design are deficient. The lifts and escalators up from the rail station to departures go through a huge covered outdoor void a strange choice in a city where the average temp is low. This looks even more of a deficiency when you enter the departures section inside and see it is cramped. People tripping over each other to deposit bags too few check-in kiosks etc.. Why did they scrimp on the area of the departures hall interior when they had literally acres of adjacent space under cover outside. Equally baffling was despite building this huge outdoor covered void the car and bus drop off areas are uncovered requiring passengers to still walk out in the rain. Again a strange choice for a wet city like London.

I travelled on a BA flight from JFK arriving into Heathrow at 06.35 with a connecting BA flight to Leeds Bradford due to fly at 08.55. We followed instructions for the transit and passed quickly through passport control. When we arrived at security it was very crowded as I realise many flights arrive in early morning. Nevertheless the queue moved and finally it was my turn. Having gone through security at JFK I hadn't thought there would be a problem but stupidly I forgot that I had a small bottle of wine from the overnight flight in my handbag. Quite rightly this was picked up and my tray set aside and joined the queue of another 8 trays of hand luggage that had to be checked. Time was suddenly against me. I realised what the problem was and asked if the bottle could be removed and rechecked to expedite myself getting to the gate. This is not possible. I was told to ask the supervisor. The rude indifference of this man was so frustrating. In the end the lady checking the bags said if the others awaiting their bags to be checked were OK to let mine go in front of theirs then she would check it. The offending bottle of wine was removed and the bag rechecked and I ran as fast any 63 year old woman can run to Gate A2 where my friend had gone to inform the staff at the gate what was happening. We got on the flight the door was closed and we pushed back. I know it was my fault but the rude indifference and almost relish of how this was handled was appalling. Next time I will go via Amsterdam.

Anyone transferring to a connecting flight here has to face the very real possibility of missing their flight and dealing with some of the most aggressive and rude security staff in the world. The connection system does not work and I'm embarrassed that this is the major hub of UK.

You really need extra time to catch your next flight if your traveling abroad especially if your traveling on a different airline like British Airways Qatar Airways etc. May I suggest that you go through security to give you extra time to catch your night flight with this terminal 2.

I was really worried after all the bad reviews but had a really nice experience. I travelled economy so no fast track or lounge for me so had the basic encounter with the airport and have no complaints whatsoever. On the first leg (on a Tuesday morning around 7.30) I timed myself from the moment I stepped off the plane until I cleared security to less than 20 minutes! Lots of signs pretty clear instructions no problem. I had to take the train to T5C again nothing to worry about. On the way back coming from SFO and connecting to BRU early afternoon of another Tuesday I deplaned the A380 and timed myself again from getting off the plane (T5C) to clearing security: about 40 minutes although security was a little bit more crowded and my bag was put on the side and double checked. Overall I had a quite good experience but I can easily understand that it can quickly become a bad one when there are lots of people or when having tight and stressful connection. I found T5A to be a little bit overcrowded but you can still manage to find a place to sit.

On my return went through security at flight connections carrying four tins of honey bought in Duty Free at Athens sealed in a transparent bag etc as per EU regulations. But at Heathrow one of these tins according to the machinery in use appeared to pose a 'threat to security' and I was told (politely) I could not carry the honey in my hand luggage but would have to check it in this meant leaving flight connections via the utterly chaotic passport control where the staff appear to be trained only to shout at travellers I checked my luggage with my airline and re-entered the main security area. The staff were rude and insolent. This experience is not the first I have made if I could I would find an alternative hub for my onward journeys from Ireland.

As for arriving by the Heathrow Express or Tube - add another 30 mins after you have your bags once you have negotiated the barriers and stranded trolleys. Why are we unable to access these services from within the building rather than having to exit and then descend via slow elevators or escalators? Give me T4 any day.

Well on a perfectly fine day without snow fog heavy rain wind etc. On the departure gate screen there were about 75% flights that were delayed. It seemed that the longer haul were taking off without delay but within Europe everyone was getting delayed. Then to make matters worse they decided to tell the passengers that the plane have \"not arrived yet\" when it was standing outside the window the whole time. 3hr delay with the plane there all along. Why? To fit 3 different flights in to 1. Again I understand that sometimes they have to do what the have to do but what I don't understand is why were 75% of all flights at Heathrow delayed?

At least passport control was fairly quiet and the luggage soon arrived on the belt which unlike my previous T2 experience was actually working. Exit to car park got in lift lift not working. Into next lift not working. Finally made it to car on level 3 in third lift.

Only 3-4 out of maybe 8-9 machines were operational and turns out it was a lot quicker to walk up to an agent where there were no queues (as an aside why are there so many desks for EU-passports that seem very lightly used when the number of desks for non-EU passport seems so inadequate - even in a new terminal?). On return to Canada was fortunate to be able to use priority check-in (very good) and avoid the chaos of general economy check-in. More long walks.

The new system is supposed to stop bags entering the belt electronically stopping bags until there is a space on the belt. If there isn't a space then the bags stop coming up from the handlers below. As the flight had a lot of people waiting to go through the border we stood and waited until someone reclaimed their bags and another one could enter the belt. Eventually a couple of baggage workers arrived and started moving the bags on the belt to make space for other bags. Clearly the bags were being held below and they were trying to sort it out.

We arrived at 13.00. Our student's flight was listed to arrive at 13.50. After about an hor the flight disappeared from the screen. We eventually found someone to ask and he said it was delayed. The passengers were all taking at least two hours to pick up their luggage! We eventually left the airport about six o'clock and parking had cost us a fortune. What s going on at London Airport?

We took 5 flights to and from T5 during our holiday. This last one was our 6th flight. We were all very tired when we got to the airport. We arrived with 3 hours to spare. We tried using the self service check in kiosk even though it never worked on our previous flights. Of course this time it didn't work again. So off we went to counter B1 for assistance. There were only 3 groups before us in that queue so we thought it won't take us long. How wrong we were. One group took 5-10 mins which was ok but the second one took over 50 mins. To make matters worse after this group finally left the staff at the counter attended to a big group which wasn't even in the queue. Of course we were not happy and moved away. My husband decided to ask the staff at self service check in kiosk to help us check in. She was attending to my husband when my kids and I joined him. She had obviously checked in some of us and then asked for the passport of the fourth person without telling me who she has already checked in because I wasn't there. I gave her the wrong passport and that's when she started talking to me condescendingly. She threatened not to proceed with checking me in. By that time my kids and husband had already been checked in I had a lot more to say to her but had to hold my tongue as all I wanted was to be checked in and get on my flight. Were finally checked in after 1.5 hrs. Just as well we arrived early. I am so shocked with how bad the service is and how the staff can get away with it. Of course our BA flight to Singapore was delayed like all other flights that we took during our holiday. This time it was delayed for 3 hours. 2 hours of that we were stuck in the plane.

Due to a late arrival our connection time was shortened to a little over an hour. We transferred easily from Terminal 5 to Terminal 3 although it takes about 15 minutes by bus to do so. However the security screening at Terminal 3 was completely unacceptable. First of all there were only 2 lines open. Secondly once it was our turn our bags were placed into a tub and then abandoned. Simply left on the belt and everyone walked away. I asked several times for someone to process us and was told someone was on their way. Several security personnel were simply standing around doing nothing. I then went to the supervisor's desk and demanded that someone process us. He told me to stop shouting at him and that he had dispatched someone. Again we waited. I explained again that we had a flight to catch. No one was interested in the least in this. Then an agent took our tub and moved it forward to a table. Then another agent came. All these agents moved at snail speed. It was like a bad movie. No one was friendly not to mention displayed any sense of urgency whatsoever. The agent then carried our tub very slowly to another desk and proceeded to review our bags. We had a pasta machine brand new unopened in the box. This then needed to be taken apart examined it might have been a weapon and only when yet another agent a supervisor and the only person with any sense in that whole bunch said that it was ok were we permitted to pack everything up and proceed.

There were only two cafes\/bar before security - A Costa and a Weatherspoon. There is also a very tiny travel shop. When we entered the check in area it was empty - not many airlines have moved to T2. There was a very polite and friendly gentleman from the airport at the entrance to give you direction and guidance. I assume because it's not occupied solely by one airlines like T5 does the check in desks seem to be more \"traditional\" and less inviting. Most of the airlines are using self check in and bag tag printing service which might save time for some but not for all. Perhaps the airport was still new and not used by many airlines and we also arrived very early the check in was very smooth and fast. Security was also fast but it will be interesting to see what happens when all airlines move in. The check in agent warned us its a long walk to get to the gate. It turned out to be a reasonable walk just a lot of stairs\/escalators going up and down. There are not many dining and shopping options in the terminal either. The signature restaurant was a big disappointment. Food was boring and plain. Shopping is also very weak. All in all it's a clean and new airport.

So we used the machines and my partners passport wouldn't scan properly so he could not get his baggage tags. We were told by the assistant that it was probably because the surname was too long on the passport (strange reason) and that in order to get a baggage tag we had to join the \"check in assistance\" line which was huge and check in his bags there. I was also told that because I had my baggage tags I had to join a different line and drop my bags off there because as I had already printed my baggage tags I would not be allowed to drop off my bags at check in assistance with my partners bags - cue Benny Hill music. So I dropped my bags off and then rejoined my partner in his line turns out a lot of people were having having problems with the self service machines not reading people's passports properly.

Once I'd collected baggage the real fun started. My options to get to Croydon are train Paddington then underground to Victoria and train to Croydon (complicated and train is expensive) underground to Victoria and train to Croydon (slow and engineering work meant no circle or district line services to Victoria) or bus direct from Heathrow to Croydon (1.5 hours but direct and cheap). How to get to central bus station? Signage in Terminal 5 is confusing and unhelpful. Man on info desk in Term 5 gave me incorrect info. Finally establish I need to get a train from Term 5 to Term 2\/3 and train only runs every 15 minutes. Is this a 3rd world airport in the middle of the night? No its London Heathrow middle of day on Bank Holiday weekend. Why is there no free regular shuttle like the one between North and South Terminals in Gatwick?

When I landed at Heathrow we were not given any directions or instructions about what we were to do next. Being an inexperienced traveler I assumed that I needed to pick up luggage so I followed the signs toward baggage claim. After standing in line for at least 10 minutes I realized that my baggage had already been sent to the next flight. The annoying thing was that nobody mentioned this to me. After baggage claim I must have made a wrong turn and got completely lost. The layout of the airport can be very confusing and there seems to be a lack of signage in some areas. I asked several employees for help and no one could put me in the right direction. Trying to find my way through this airport was like running through an endless maze. By the time I reached the boarding gate I had just missed my flight by about 5 mins. I went to the counter to have them put me on the next flight. Told it was my fault and had to charge me $275. The return trip was much easier because I knew that I didn't have to pick up luggage and I was with a group of people so that made it easier. As soon as we got off the plane there was an information display listing terminals according to the airlines so it was simply a matter of following signs to the terminal and departure gate. How did I miss this on my first trip? Where was the information display or clear signs in the baggage area? I guess I simply took the longer confusing route. I suppose some terminals may be smaller or easier to navigate then others. There are some nice restaurants and shops and the flights were pleasant but I will still try to avoid this airport in the future after this awful experience."},{"date":"2014-04-16","overall_rating":"7.00","author_country":"United Kingdom","content":"I really feel sorry for British Airways at T5 as they have an otherwise excellent terminal ruined by Security and Immigration which are out of their control.

Then the joys of Heathrow security queuing for 15 minutes and then being told the equipment had broken and join the back of another queue for another 15 minute wait.

My experiences however are quite the opposite. I've flown from LHR a few times over the last couple of years and my last trip was to and from Terminal 5 in April 2014. The terminal building is light airy and clean. Everything is well sign-posted and there's a good choice of landslide coffee shops restaurants and pubs. Along with a pharmacy bureaux de change and other amenities. Although there are plenty of staff on hand I would say that the queuing system for check-in needs an overhaul. Despite being able to check-in at any desk one is left to queue at each desk individually; if a problem arises with a passenger in front then you are stuck waiting for that check-in agent whilst other passengers on surrounding desks move to the front. Despite some reviews I have always found the security process through to the departures lounge to be very quick and professional. On my latest trip I waited around 30 seconds. You can tell that the airport authority has invested a lot of money on the screening equipment used. I don't know whether some passengers aren't used to stringent security but I feel reassured and have never encountered a rude member of security staff. In fact I've found them to be both approachable and friendly. Terminal 5 is a giant shopping mall it has to be said - and an expensive one at that. But the fantastic panoramic views and beautiful sunlight coming through the expansive windows is enough to compensate for the commercialism. There's a good choice of bars and eateries. Unlike some other terminals at Heathrow you don't have to walk nearly as far to get to your gate but be warned - If you are travelling from gates marked 'B' or 'C' then you have to get an underground shuttle train to a satellite terminal and this can take 15 minutes. On arrival back to the UK I was through immigration in a couple of minutes and had my luggage a few minutes after that. Back in the arrivals hall and then onto the Heathrow Express - an (incredibly) expensive but convenient way to get from airport to city in less than half an hour."},{"date":"2014-04-10","overall_rating":"0.00","author_country":"United States","content":"If you have respiratory ailments or allergies do not fly through or use London Heathrow!

When we arrived at passport control there was not one single person to speak to. Many passengers were getting connecting flights and looked so confused. They were just left to read the electronic boards. Surely someone should have been on duty to help these passengers. Then as we approached the Passport control area several big flights had obviously come in at the same time but as we had electronic passports we thought we would be okay and would get through quickly. Wrong! UK and EU citizens were all herded into one area and it was not clear that the EPassport area was not available but we did finally see a small A4 sheet of paper which said that the epassport scanners were not operational until 5.30 am. It was 5.20 am so decided to stay in the long queue although some people started queuing for the epassport section. There were two female attendants to the right of this area and when I approached them to ask if I could go through with my epassport I was told quite sternly that I should join the large queue to my left. Then another official came on the scene and looked confused at the large queues and then proceeded to check the scanners and eventually invited people to use the escanners. However these did not appear to work properly because they were not giving any messages out. When one guy removed his passport because it didn't seem to be working the gates opened. This happened to a couple of people. Another member of staff joined the one guy on duty but they did not seem capable of helping people. I stood for ages with my passport in the scanner and eventually tried another one which eventually worked. My husband said that maybe the scanners need to warm up but surely the staff should know this and be on hand to help and advise. What an awful welcome for overseas visitors I was embarrassed because Terminal 5 is a super terminal but the staff need to be more helpful and welcoming to visitors.

On outward leg (LHR-IAD) with British Airways bag drop was very quick although the check-in lady could do with a smile. I'm impressed with the structure of this terminal with its wide open walkways and high ceilings very reminiscent of the Asian Airports. It also has the sense of freshness something that all the other 4 terminals lack. Security was a bit slow and took an age considering the number of people in the queue. One thing I must say was after security it was very very busy. Quite surprising considering the vastness of the terminal! Perhaps it was because of the holiday season. Very good range of shops and restaurants\/cafes etc and good to see that duty-free isn't a rip off! Next came the walk to our gate which was in the 'B' section of the terminal which meant using the light rail system. Very long escalator trip down to the bottom where the train was located. Must've taken a good 2 minutes without walking. Train was punctual and quick. Disappointing though that if you have a gate located in the 'B' or 'C' section you are cut away from the main terminal which contains the best of shops. Only shop in the B area was a whsmiths. Nevertheless I liked the effort Heathrow have made to move away from the '10km' walk to the gate so to speak. Plane left on time and was overall a pleasant experience. Inward journey was from EWR back to terminal 5. Disappointed that we were not given an air bridge to leave our British Airways plane; somewhat strange considering that this is their hub which means they should have the best facilities for their passengers. Bus took us to the main complex which was near passport control. We were wary of the times we've had to wait in the past so 25 minutes seemed standard. Bag carousel was big and 'airy' and bags were there ready to be picked up. Heathrow connect service to terminal 4 was okay; somewhat tedious since there is no direct service so an interchange is required. Bus to car park was punctual but a bit small. Overall an impressive turn around from the horrible days of cramped airports and long marathon walks to the gate.

We asked how long we would have to wait in the wheelchair holding area and even the supervisor said anything from 5 minutes to 5 hours. The British philosophy of security seems to be to zero in on easy targets no common sense is applied such as spending 20 minutes on a 90 year old wheelchair passenger. Lastly having to ride a train several times as well as go through security again and then sit around waiting for a gate number which might mean yet another train ride is just about the worst scenario you can devise for people who have to ride in cramped poorly air conditioned planes for perhaps 12 hours to get to Heathrow and then have to do the same to their next destination.

If you begin your journey at Heathrow disability assistance drives you to a series of checkpoints where typically you will sit unable to leave with a supervisor who hardly speaks any English. Even if you start out 3-4 hours before your flight you might have no opportunity to shop or get some food. If you have a transfer through Heathrow disability assistance insists on driving you to a checkpoint near passport control where you will be stuck for some time while the assistance staff socialises with one another and inefficiently makes its future plans. Last time we flew through Heathrow was 9-10 months ago. We had a tight connection made still tighter by the aforementioned Heathrow slow flush cycle. Disability assistance came late then sat there for 10 minutes then drove to the checkpoint and sat for 15 minutes doing nothing. Luckily a BA tight connections assistant came by and checked out tickets for the connection we were already late to board so that it would not leave without us. She also gave us orange \"short connection\" passes and asked the disability assistance to hurry up but neither was to any avail. Then we walked the remaining distance to the gate which took another 10 minutes. We were met by about ten BA employees at the gate who were horrified at how long it took for us to be escorted through the airport on a tight connection.

Because this means you have to go to from terminal 1 to 3 by bus (this service was good) there is not much time to loose. We could go in a fast lane for the security check of our hand luggage. Our bags were put aside for further checks. One lady was performing the checks. There were 3 people before us whose luggage was put aside. The result was one staff member performing her duty incredibly slowly. I stayed at the security checkpoint waiting for our bags to be checked in the meanwhile my partner went to the airline desk to explain what was happening. After 20 minutes waiting (in that time the luggage of 3 persons was checked) finally our bags were checked. Of course nothing was wrong with our bags. We had to run to catch our flight we were the last passengers to board. This was an extremely stressful experience and all due to the misuse of power by the security staff. Very unprofessional! In the future we will avoid London Heathrow when booking flights!

The rest of the airside area was extremely busy with a lot of floor space taken up with designer label shops. Fortunately I had access to an airline lounge although even that was short of seats.

I ended up having to stand at that airport in line to rebook my flight for over 8+ hours. When getting off of the plane we had to get off on stairs because the ramps were not available then when you actually get inside the airport (Terminal 5) there are escalators and you could hardly find an elevator anywhere. It wasn't just the fact that we missed our connecting flight that made the experience so bad but the fact that there was such little communication about what we were expected to do next after that and the fact that there was not anywhere to sit down nor enough elevators or moving ramps etc. As far as I'm concerned they need to revamp this Terminal even further to make it more disability friendly and train their staff better to handle delays and emergencies and provide more assistance to travelers who may need a little extra help."},{"date":"2013-06-09","overall_rating":"2.00","author_country":"United Arab Emirates","content":"Used this airport to transfer a number of times this year so far.

So 30 min later I got through the passport desk (in about 5 secs). Then there was the biometric queue completely OTT for transiting passengers. Then the confusing way to get to security. Then the security screen. As noted before very rude inefficient staff. There is no reason the whole queue should stop because someone has been pulled over for screening but this is what happens.

When I attempted to rebook I was initially directed to the wrong desk by an airport employee and when I found the correct one I had to queue for 30 minutes. On the return leg my transit through Terminal 5 started smoothly enough with plane landing on time then I encountered the theatre that is airport security and no one does it better the LHR! The first act was a pleasant woman checking my boarding pass then a quick passport check at the next desk. Next I was a little taken aback when I had to have my photo taken 'for security purposes' apparently. I then proceeded to security screening I passed through without making anything bleep. After waiting 30 minutes for the gate to appear on the departure board I headed there and awaited boarding. Imagine my surprise when again G4S wanted to take my picture but had no wish to look at my passport nor any other official identification document. Another 10 minutes delay on the ground and I was finally out of that nightmare. My main gripe is with the taking of passenger pictures of a UK citizen at a UK airport on a domestic flight this is intrusion of my privacy and completely unnecessary. My passport verifies my identity and contains my photo. I travel about 30k miles year on business and have instructed our travel company not to book me any flights via LHR again unless it is absolutely and instead send me via Amsterdam or Paris even if it means more time travelling.

Between Heathrow Security and British Airways the matter of how you deal with those on immediately connecting flights should be reviewed. Surely this doubling of scanning and arbitrary seizure of duty free goods is a waste of time personnel and goods. Connecting passengers are under your purview the entire time they are in Heathrow. There is neither time nor opportunity to purchase duty free while sprinting to the gate. (There isn't even time to go to the bathroom).

Turned out that our plane was still in Moscow because of the weather so there was a 6-hour delay at most. We were given \u00a325 to spend each in the airport though which explained the queue. Security was surprisingly swift very friendly staff. Giraffe restaurant very good not too expensive. Waiting seats are very hard comparable to park benches. Free Wi-Fi and good range of plug sockets. Something striking is the very long distances to walk to gates. It was a good 10 minute walk even with travelators! On return taxi to gate was very swift and we left the plane quickly. Immigration is in desperate need of a review in terms of services. Very long queues insufficient tables for filling out details (for some reason we weren't given them on the plane).

The two stores that passengers were buying anything at all are Boots and WH Smith because they have the least expensive items in all of the airport. Security is completely out of hand. Security is overwhelmed due to the number of passengers that travel through this airport. It is my thought that Security has a policy of confiscating items for twofold reasons you're tired and don't want to even bother questioning and that they want you to go purchase the item from one of the stores in the airport. There are few comfortable places to sit and in most cases not enough places to sit. Interesting that they can't have a quiet zone for adults.

T3 is good though it has decent shops\/restaurants\/bars and quite a lot of them. One thing that obviously needs improving though is the security check\/x-ray.

At Australian airports such 2nd random searches are carried out promptly and courteously by another officer further on in the process and that's fine. However at Heathrow Terminal 1 I had my bag left in a side rack for ages with staff wandering off somewhere else for a chat and a laugh.

We had an easy departure from our plane despite having to wait till last due to having a family member on crutches. The airport staff immediately arrived with a wheelchair for assistance and then fetched a golf buggy to get us around quicker. Staff were very friendly and we got through immigration within a matter of minutes. Having had to wait behind on the plane our bags had concluded their cycle on the conveyor belt so ours had been placed to one side to collect which further sped things up.

I have to clear immigration before connecting to my UK flight and there is always no more than two Border Agency officers on duty. They are either belligerent or disinterested towards non-EU passengers like myself. There are two lines-one for EU citizens and the other for non-EU citizens-where each time the officers give preference towards EU citizens while ignoring those in the non-EU line. My advice is for non-EU citizens to make sure to have at least 2 hours to transit because of this ridiculous practice. As to security it has become a nightmare recently. On my most recent experience my handbag was 'randomly' selected for a thorough search. To make matters worse the security officials take their leisurely time. I did not have my handbag checked until after a good 20 minutes of waiting around. They do not care that many passengers are in a hurry to catch their flights! Instead I noticed officials joking and talking amongst themselves oblivious to these randomly selected bags they need to check because passengers are waiting for them! This type of supposedly extreme checking is a huge farce really accomplishes nothing but hassle to the passengers. If not for the immigration & security issues Heathrow's T5 is quite nice provided one has time to actually relax and shop and eat.

Passport control and security was empty and so we split up between fast track and normal both ending at the same time. I was searched and x-rayed routinely but it was an efficient and non-invasive process. Excellent facilities for shopping and eating but there is one drawback with T5 which is the short amount of time they leave to publish the departing gate number which was alright for our flight as it was an A gate but there were B and C gates being called close to departure which does not allow for enough time to be given to transfer to the satellite terminals comfortably. Boarding was pleasant with priority boarding and happy staff. Inbound: The C satellite terminal had problems trying to attach the tunnel to the plane which meant we lost the 20 minutes of flight time we had made up as well as extra time but the captain and crew were very reassuring. Once we were disembarked the transition to the main terminal was quick and efficient with a train for the transit system arriving at C as we made it to the platform. Immigration was fast with staff that wee polite and friendly and too interest in your travels.

The approach to the check in counters from the underground must rank as some of the worst anywhere in the world with water leaking from behind a wall seeping across a filthy floor making it extremely slippery and dangerous. However the absolute worst aspect is the understaffed immigration queues. I know it's a constant complaint of those of us unfortunate enough to have to use this airport but management seriously has to start to listen. Clearly understaffed the few officials who are tasked with processing arrivals are obviously over stretched and are struggling to cope with what is being asked of them. I don't blame them for being snappy and irritable as the job they have been given is close to unmanageable but its an absolutely appalling way to welcome visitors to this country to make them stand in endless queues while only 3 or 4 counters out of an available 20 or so are staffed.

The Baggage wait was an average of 45 minutes which is not good in a Baggage Hall which didn't appear to be especially busy.

I had great expectations when T5 opened but they were promptly dashed. Unbelievable to find a modern airport terminal where you still have to pay for internet use and with coins. Another piece of bad planning is the placing of the information signs when you come through departure security. As you gather your scattered belongings you look around for signs - and at first glance there is nothing. They're there but not immediately obvious. You have to wander around a bit and get the right angle of approach. Needlessly unsettling when you're already stressed. Terminal 4 - last experienced but never to be forgotten just before Terminal 5 opened. We were booked from Oslo to Johannesburg with BA but when the BA flight from Oslo was delayed we missed the connecting flight. We saw the last passengers go in and the doors close but the staff we pleaded with to get us on the plane were unmoved. We were put into a hotel and booked on the next flight to Johannesburg which was a KLM flight but unfortunately only early the next morning. We were issued with tickets for a bus that hadn't started running by the time we left for the airport. Our luggage of course remained at Heathrow. Over the next 2 weeks we phoned the airport daily. Yes they assured us our luggage was at Heathrow - they could even describe it to us. But at Heathrow it remained though nobody could explain why.

Perhaps being here early on a Saturday morning helped but I was pleasantly surprised after expecting the worst. I went from the gate at T5 to my seat in the lounge at T3 in just over 30 minutes; not bad at all for an airport this size. My one complaint is the lack of information on how to transfer to a non-BA airline. All you see are signs that indicate connections within T5 and for connections through \"all other terminals\".

When I get to one of the many restaurants did the experience improve. Here service was fast and efficient. A visit to one of the many toilet showed them to be fairly well kept and in good working order.

Even if you do find a relatively quiet area there is a constant barrage of PA announcements. Since I was not a premium passenger I could not use the lounges and there are no pay lounges.

T1 is not too bad though it feels like a crowded shopping mall but there are quieter places to sit the waiting areas at the departure gates are rather depressing. Queues for security and immigration were both fairly lengthy. T3 for check-in and arrivals last week was quite good but once in the departure area it is an unpleasant environment: crowded with insufficient seating and no view.

Once past security terminal 5 has a lot to offer plenty of places to eat and drink and lots of shops.

They got into my bag and took out a ziplock bag of medicine that I had for my high blood pressure. The medicine was in liquid form and was accompanied by a doctor's prescription. The airport security took it away and said it was not permitted on the plane. They said that it would be sent to me and gave me a ticket receipt. When I went online it turned out they wanted me to pay $70 to send the medicine from England to Latvia. A complete rip-off.

Arrival from JFK at T5; and absolute joy. Clean bright terminal with plenty of space and well-laid out. UK border control inwards a breeze through the EU passports line (queued for less than 5 mins after 0700 arrival on a Sat) and baggage already waiting at carousel. Reached the big bright arrivals hall in less than 30 mins after touchdown. At an airport like LHR such a feat is impressive. Whether departing or arriving T5 is always a pleasure. Easy transfer to T3 with the LHR express but T3 itself is another story. It is cramped and all thoroughfares are jammed with throngs of pax mostly with overloaded baggage trollies. Seating is an option only if you buy something at one of the food outlets. Queuing at security is efficient thanks to the staff who constantly keep watch and regularly re-distribute the queue. I never sit in the central seating area\/food court. Too much like a shopping mall and always unpleasantly overcrowded and noisy. I always go through late enough to have my gate number posted on the FID's and head straight there and it's usually fairly painless. Queues security etc. are all fairly tedious I agree but considering that LHR is the world's busiest airport it performs well.

What a contrast after arriving on a Friday morning from Australia I was through in no time at all. Come one week later on a Sunday night transferring through London for one night arriving from Madrid and we spent longer in the queue to get into the customs hall than the flight time itself! No security issue just pure volume of numbers. Strongly recommend if you are an elderly traveller you request airline wheelchair assistance if using this airport more than 2 hours on your feet after a long flight is not a pleasant welcome.

Apart from this the process was smooth. As usual once you are through the security T5 is a fantastic place. We had a meal at Wagamama - a very spacious restaurant very clean although the staff were grumpy and not efficient.

We were out within 30 minutes of landing."},{"date":"2010-06-23","overall_rating":"4.00","author_country":"United Kingdom","content":"Departed from T3 early morning (Air Canada) and arrived back early morning. I frequently use T1 and T5 and have very positive opinions on the arrival experience - generally very fast and smooth with the exception of T5 when BA flights can't find a gate to park. T3 has improved significantly. The building is still very old and the departure hall is still like a third world airport. However it is not as crowded as it used to be not a long queue in front of security. Some annoying passengers questioned why they had to take off their accessories water etc but you encounter those kind of passengers everywhere in the world. After security there are plenty of shopping. Heathrow is probably the best place for airport shopping partly due to the exchange rate. Arrival was a good experience. Its a long walk as usual but for EU\/UK passport holder or those using Iris scan there was no queue at all. You whip through immigration in a second. Then the luggage came out before I even arrived at the belt."},{"date":"2010-06-23","overall_rating":"2.00","author_country":"Switzerland","content":"T5 - Horrific transfer took 1h15 to get from the aircraft and through security impatient staff chaos at the top of the escalator and security staff unsure of where Geneva was. However domestic transfer did not involve passport or security checks so no issues."},{"date":"2010-06-17","overall_rating":"3.00","author_country":"Denmark","content":"There is a huge difference according to which terminal you use. We used T3 and T4. T3 is very boring looks like it was built in the 1970's and not well maintained whereas T4 was a fine experience with good shopping possibilities. I wonder why there are no carts available airside - it is not good for shopping or the passengers which carries handbaggage."},{"date":"2010-05-24","overall_rating":"5.00","author_country":"United Kingdom","content":"I have come through Heathrow a few times now for domestic flights between London and Belfast. I've had no problem or mishaps and found the airport as I would wish to. Although the walking distance is quite long the routes are always well signposted and it is easy to get to where I need to be. If you have any mobility issues then assistance might well be advised to help you cover the potentially large distances involved with getting around such a huge airport. The shops and cafes that are available are also very good (although a little pricey)."},{"date":"2010-05-23","overall_rating":"5.00","author_country":"South Africa","content":"Much as I dislike BA and have avoided them for years I had no choice for a recent trip. T5 is almost enough reason to resume travelling with BA. It's light and airy no queues employees who clearly enjoy working in such a lovely environment and a quick and easy transition from arrival to departure. An example for others to follow. A pity that the cabin crew on the BA flight were surly and haughty which detracted from the initial good experience of T5. The ratings I have given refer to T5 not to Heathrow in general."},{"date":"2010-05-23","overall_rating":"4.00","author_country":"United Kingdom","content":"T5 is generally a great experience. Slightly odd desk staffing policy at check-in and it can sometimes be an issue knowing where to go - BA staff on foot around desks are not very pro- active in moving people to empty desks. Anyway security has always been quick for me and staff courteous. Loads of shops\/places to eat but still never feels crowded and noisy even at peak times. Tonnes of natural light. In all compared to previous offerings in T4 (or the dreaded T3) this is a real haven for Heathrow!"},{"date":"2010-05-10","overall_rating":"2.00","author_country":"Canada","content":"Terminal 3 has had a face lift but it's superficial improvement. I don't like the design of T5 with gates in the waiting area. Outbound flight to Amsterdam on BA involved a bus trip to the plane surprising requirement given the money spent on building a new terminal. Return to LHR from AMS was nothing short of a joke. Arrived in heavy rain airbridge at assigned gate wouldn't work because of the weather. A few U-turns around Heathrow later arrive at another gate. Airbridge makes it 2 feet from the plane and gives up - reason: rain. Have to wait for stairs to arrive so we can have a nice wet walk to the terminal. Time from landing to deplaning about the same as the flight itself."},{"date":"2010-05-07","overall_rating":"4.00","author_country":"United Kingdom","content":"Flew out of T1 to Munich: speedy check in using the self service terminal and quickly and efficiently handled bag drop. The 'queue' at security was just two people so no delays whatsoever. It definitely seems to be a better experience at Heathrow these days!"},{"date":"2010-04-20","overall_rating":"5.00","author_country":"United Kingdom","content":"Travelled out of T5 for the third time in 6 months. I use the Valet car park so from dropping off your car it's easy to be airside inside 10 mins. The terminal is light airy and no feeling of claustrophobia shopping and food options are good. Easy transit to the B and C gates."},{"date":"2010-04-14","overall_rating":"4.00","author_country":"United Kingdom","content":"Flew T4 to Houston and back. Last previous use of T4 was in March 2008 and the overall experience is much improved. Arrival at the terminal and check-in is now far superior although this has resulted in airside looking somewhat grubby in comparison especially at the gates. Arrivals was very busy with almost no space in which to queue for immigration. Overall a big improvement."},{"date":"2010-04-12","overall_rating":"4.00","author_country":"United Kingdom","content":"T1 is great now for passengers. I flew to DUB on BMI and the flight left from Gate 84 - this is 20 minutes from clearing security and where Aer Lingus operate their flights. Something to note because of the layout if passengers are disembarking doors are shut so you cannot get through - be careful if you are in need of the loo!"},{"date":"2010-04-12","overall_rating":"3.00","author_country":"Australia","content":"In and out using T3 . Inbound transit was quick but surely the crowd controllers for non EU passport holders should be able to speak more languages. Outbound the waiting lounge was a disappointment. Having used T5 on a previous visit to UK the overall impression of T3 was not good."},{"date":"2010-03-18","overall_rating":"4.00","author_country":"United Kingdom","content":"Used T5 for the first time a much better experience than T3. There is plenty of natural light the toilets are clean and there are great views of the runways. The seating could be better lots of bench seats akin to T3 but there was some comfortable seats and lie down sofas by gates A7."},{"date":"2010-03-18","overall_rating":"3.00","author_country":"Malaysia","content":"Flew in and out of both Terminal 3 and 5 respectively and found Terminal 3 to be the same as it was two years back. Immigration queues for the non-EU passports were amazingly long and I wonder why the BAA authorities cannot work something out and make the terminal more user friendly and immigration friendly ? Terminal 5 on the other hand was a breeze and the modern architecture gave it a nice feeling. The Self Check In Kiosk is such a brilliant idea and saves a lot of time and hassle."},{"date":"2010-03-18","overall_rating":"4.00","author_country":"Ireland","content":"Heathrow is a very impressive operation. The part I was in was a bit jaded and grubby and chaotic. But all in all my LHR experience was very positive. Loads of places to eat and shop. Some decent views of the apron from the boarding gates. What I like most about Heathrow is the sheer quantity off carriers operating on all manner of routes from that airport. It really is a world class hub. And I am sure that if I has been travelling through the new T5 - I would have found the upkeep of the facilities that more bit clean and aesthetic."},{"date":"2010-03-03","overall_rating":"4.00","author_country":"United Kingdom","content":"Used Terminal 4 to fly to and from Nairobi. It has improved a lot since the recent terminal changes and although busy it felt less crowded and claustrophobic than before. There were very few queues of any great length which helped make it less stressful too. Credit where it is due - this airport is improving."},{"date":"2010-02-27","overall_rating":"4.00","author_country":"Canada","content":"Return trip from DUB to DEL transferring at Terminal One for Terminal Four. We found the transfer process relatively flawless even though our bags were not checked through. We took the elevator down to the train and found it quick and comfortable compared to many airports. This is a great improvement on previous connections made at LHR. Terminal Four lacks facilities airside not many eateries to choose from. Terminal One seemed better but the walk to the aircraft is way too long."},{"date":"2010-02-26","overall_rating":"2.00","author_country":"United Kingdom","content":"Terminal 3 quick check-in with Virgin Atlantic 2\u00bd hours before departure. We were requested to go straight to airside then proceed to gate 2 hours before departure in order to allow for Gate security. However we were turned away from primary security being told passengers not allowed through until 2 hours before departure. Once allowed into security the queue was moderate. No gate listed until 1 hour before departure so had to endure the crowded shopping mall for an hour. BAA policy on using most of the space for shopping really does make using LHR terminals a depressingly uncomfortable experience."},{"date":"2010-02-22","overall_rating":"5.00","author_country":"United Kingdom","content":"First time using T5 - excellent. BA land agent was able to tell me all about the terminal and where to go when I got airside. BAA had staff on hand airside to assist travellers. Departed from B gates to USA. Security at gate was thorough but good humoured. Had to get a bus to the plane - so what. Bags waiting at carousel on return. Excellent first experience."}]}
